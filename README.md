Crowdsensing is the umbrella term for the idea ofindividuals, or rather “crowds”, contribute data through “sens-ing” for a common interest. We have designed and implementeda crowdsensing system solution for low-cost and scalable pave-ment monitoring

Nationwide, over 19% of the roads are in poor conditionsand require repair, which consequently leads to loss of billionsof dollars a year in congestion and delays. This results inan extra 3.1 billion gallons of fuel wasted. It is desirable toconstantly monitor the pavement condition of the road networkso that preventive maintenance can be timely scheduled andperformed. The task of detecting, classifying and tabulatingdata of pavement conditions is a tedious task. With 4.18million miles of road in the United States, it is intuitivelytime consuming and cost intensive to monitor the conditionsof such a large transportation network. As 77% of this mileageis maintained by local governments, 19% by state, and 4% byfederal and due to budget constraints, a large portion of theroad networks are not monitored.
